# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
For the following project an analysis was made on the reviews made to videogames by various users. We will have two type of users the paid Amazon Vine memebers, who are required to publish a review and the rest of users that are not part of the Amazon Vine Program. These are not required to review the product and we will be categorizing them as unpaid Vine members.
## Results

## Summary
From the results we can see that in the videogames category the amount of 5 star reviews is good. Around 57% of the reviews are 5 Star this meaning that the other 43% is distribuited along the other categories which is pretty good. The amount of 5 star reviews from Vine members is pretty low because of the amount of non-Vine reviews the dataset has. As another possibly analysis on the data would be see how the other 43% is distribuited among the other star categories and also make an analysis in only Vine members reviews and see if the percentages are similar to non-Vine members.
